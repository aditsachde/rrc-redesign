# Georgia Tech’s Highest Flying Team!
 
The High-Altitude Balloons division is focused on producing the highest-flying and longest-running flights in the RRC!

The team is currently working on an advanced system designed to provide live updates during the ascent to 100,000 ft above sea level with a long-term goal of creating a “picoballoon” and circumnavigating the globe with it.

HAB hopes to mature their program and offer a safe research platform for labs around Georgia Tech to test components at high altitudes.
